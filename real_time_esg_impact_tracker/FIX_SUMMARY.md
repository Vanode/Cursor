# Fix Summary - Companies and Alerts Loading Issue

## Problem Identified
The frontend was showing "Failed to load companies" and "Failed to load alerts" because:
1. **No database file existed** - The SQLite database (`esg_tracker.db`) had not been initialized
2. **Missing dependencies** - Some Python packages needed to be installed
3. **No seed data** - Even if the database existed, it was empty with no companies or alerts to display

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Initialization
- Created the SQLite database at `/workspace/real_time_esg_impact_tracker/esg_tracker.db`
- Initialized all required tables:
  - `companies` - Stores company information
  - `esg_scores` - Stores Environmental, Social, and Governance scores
  - `alerts` - Stores ESG alerts and warnings

### 2. Seed Data Added
The database now contains sample data to demonstrate the application:

**Companies (3):**
- GreenTech Inc. (Technology)
  - Environmental: 85.5, Social: 78.2, Governance: 92.0, Overall: 85.2
- EcoEnergy Corp. (Energy)
  - Environmental: 90.0, Social: 82.5, Governance: 88.0, Overall: 86.8
- SustainableGoods Ltd. (Retail)
  - Environmental: 72.3, Social: 85.7, Governance: 79.5, Overall: 79.2

**Alerts (4):**
- 1 critical alert
- 1 warning alert
- 2 info alerts

### 3. Dependencies Installed
Installed essential Python packages:
- Flask (web framework)
- flask-sqlalchemy (database ORM)
- flask-cors (CORS support)
- requests (HTTP requests)
- python-dotenv (environment variables)
- numpy (numerical computing)
- textblob (NLP for sentiment analysis)
- feedparser (RSS feed parsing)
- beautifulsoup4 (web scraping)

**Note:** Full ML dependencies (scikit-learn, transformers, torch) were not installed due to Python 3.13 compatibility issues, but the application will work with basic functionality.

## How to Run the Server

### Option 1: Using the startup script
```bash
cd /workspace/real_time_esg_impact_tracker
./start_server.sh
```

### Option 2: Using Python directly
```bash
cd /workspace/real_time_esg_impact_tracker
python3 -m backend.app
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

## What You Should See Now

1. **Dashboard Cards (Top):**
   - Environmental: 82.6
   - Social: 82.1
   - Governance: 86.5
   - Overall Score: 83.7
   
2. **Company ESG Scores Section:**
   - Three companies listed with their individual E, S, G, and Overall scores
   - Each company shows their industry
   
3. **ESG Alerts Section:**
   - Four alerts displayed with:
     - Severity badges (critical/warning/info)
     - Alert messages
     - Active/Resolved status
     - Timestamps

## API Endpoints Working

The following API endpoints are now functional:

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/alerts/` - List all alerts
- `GET /api/alerts/companies` - List all companies with ESG scores
- `POST /api/analyze/company` - Analyze a company (basic functionality)
- `POST /api/alerts/detect` - Detect ESG risks

## Known Limitations

1. **ML Features Limited:** Advanced machine learning features (transformers, scikit-learn models) are not available due to Python 3.13 compatibility issues. The app will use basic NLP with TextBlob instead.

2. **Data Collection:** Real-time data collection from external sources will work but with limited features due to missing ML libraries.

3. **Ollama Integration:** If you want to use Ollama for additional AI insights, ensure Ollama is running at `http://localhost:11434`

## Next Steps

1. **Start the server** using one of the methods above
2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
3. **Verify the data loads** - You should see the three sample companies and four alerts
4. **Try analyzing a new company** by entering a company name in the analysis form

## Testing the Fix

To verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check database exists and has data
cd /workspace/real_time_esg_impact_tracker
sqlite3 esg_tracker.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM companies; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM alerts;"

# 2. Start the server
./start_server.sh

# 3. In another terminal, test the API
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/alerts/companies
curl http://localhost:5000/api/alerts/
```

## Summary

✅ Database initialized with tables and seed data
✅ Core dependencies installed
✅ Flask application tested and working
✅ API endpoints functional
✅ Frontend should now load companies and alerts successfully

The "Failed to load companies" and "Failed to load alerts" errors are now fixed!
