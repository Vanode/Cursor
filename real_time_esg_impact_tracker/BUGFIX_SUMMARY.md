# Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing ESGScore Import in alerts.py** ✅
**Problem:** The `/api/alerts/companies` endpoint was failing because `ESGScore` model was used but not imported.

**Location:** `backend/routes/alerts.py` line 6

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before:
from backend.database.models import Alert, Company

# After:
from backend.database.models import Alert, Company, ESGScore
```

**Impact:** 
- The company list will now display correctly
- Companies with their latest ESG scores will be retrieved from the database
- No more `NameError: name 'ESGScore' is not defined` errors

### 2. **Parameter Handling Verification** ✅
**Verified:** All frontend parameters are correctly sent and received by the backend:

- `max_articles` parameter: ✅ Correctly passed to `/api/analyze/company` and used in analysis
- `riskThreshold` parameter: ✅ Correctly passed to `/api/alerts/detect` and used for risk detection  
- `autoCreateAlerts` parameter: ✅ Correctly used to determine whether to auto-create alerts

**Locations Verified:**
- Frontend: `frontend/app.js` lines 78-80, 92-95, 111-114
- Backend analyze: `backend/routes/analyze.py` lines 55-56, 61
- Backend alerts: `backend/routes/alerts.py` lines 218, 230, 234-254

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue was a **missing import statement** in the alerts route. When the frontend tried to fetch the companies list via the `/api/alerts/companies` endpoint (line 152 in `app.js`), the backend code at line 367 in `alerts.py` attempted to query the `ESGScore` model:

```python
latest_score = ESGScore.query.filter_by(company_id=company.id)\
    .order_by(ESGScore.created_at.desc()).first()
```

Without the import, this caused a `NameError`, resulting in:
- Empty company list on the frontend
- Potentially empty alerts list if companies weren't created
- Analysis not updating display because the refresh failed

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd real_time_esg_impact_tracker
   python backend/app.py
   ```

2. **Open the frontend** in a browser at `http://localhost:5000`

3. **Test company analysis:**
   - Enter a company name (e.g., "Tesla", "Apple", "Microsoft")
   - Adjust advanced settings (optional):
     - Risk threshold: Controls sensitivity of risk detection
     - Max articles: Number of articles to analyze (5-100)
     - Auto-create alerts: Whether to automatically create alerts for detected risks
   - Click "Analyze Company"
   - Verify that:
     - Analysis completes successfully
     - Company appears in "Company ESG Scores" section
     - ESG scores are displayed (E, S, G, Overall)
     - Alerts appear if risks were detected and auto-create is enabled

4. **Test data persistence:**
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify companies and alerts still appear
   - Check that average scores are calculated correctly

## Files Modified

- `backend/routes/alerts.py` - Added ESGScore to imports

## No Changes Required

The following were verified to be working correctly:
- `frontend/app.js` - Parameter handling
- `backend/routes/analyze.py` - Analysis endpoint
- `backend/database/models.py` - Data models
- All service modules (ml_analyzer, nlp_pipeline, data_collector)
